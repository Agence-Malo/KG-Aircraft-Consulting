        <h2>Your Boutique Aviation Operator Crafted With Soul</h2>
        <p className={"text-justify"} ref={ref}>
          JetHouse is not just another business aviation operator. We are a team
          of experienced and passionate business aviation professionals with a
          single objective: “Focus, and never deviate, from what business
          aviation clients expect from an operator.” At JetHouse, we want to
          restore the true meaning of what a boutique operation is.
